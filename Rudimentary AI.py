def rudimentaryAI(hand, community_cards):
    '''This part needs to be a series of expected value comparisons or something.
    I don't really know how to code this part.
    The AI needs to be able to judge the relative worth of its own hand
    and the risk that the relative worth of the player's hand is better.
    It needs to do this without being able to care about bluffing.
    I guess a weighted average?
